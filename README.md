# Scrape-RV

In this project I will be using web scraping
In order to run code from the command line, instead of the notebook, I can save the code to a file (with a .py extension), and run it using the Python interpreter:

python my_file.py

I will be building a process to scrape a single category of search results on Craigslist, that can easily be applied to other categories by changing the search terms. The main goal is to be able to target and scrape a single page given a set of parameters.
I use Scrapy, so will provide the code in a folder.
