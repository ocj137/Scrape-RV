# Scrape-RV

This project uses web scraping. Code can be run from the command line,instead of the notebook;save the code to a file (with a .py extension), and run it using the Python interpreter:

python my_file.py

Build a process to scrape a single category of search results on Craigslist, that can easily be applied to other categories by changing the search terms. The main goal is to be able to target and scrape a single page given a set of parameters.
I use Scrapy, so will provide the code in a folder.
